# The following is the order of the links in the header of the website.  以下为网站头部链接的排列顺序。
#
# Changing the order here will adjust the order and you can also add additional links. 
# Removing a link prevents it from showing in the header, but does not prevent it from being included in the site.
# 删除一个链接会使其不在头部显示，但不会阻止其被包含在网站中。
#
# NOTE that only one of the CV options should be selected, the first is for the
#      Markdown formatted page while the second is generated using JSON.
