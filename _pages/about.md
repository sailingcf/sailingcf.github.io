I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Physics and Electronic Information at [Gannan Normal University](https://www.gnnu.edu.cn/).
I received my M.S. degree in Control Engineering in 2020 and my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering in 2025 from [Guangdong University of Technology](https://www.gdut.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shuting Cai](https://sme.gdut.edu.cn/info/1018/2430.htm) and [Prof. Bo Liu](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/liubo1/zh_CN/index.htm), respectively. 
Following my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Assistant at Guangdong University of Technology, focusing on AI-based solutions for engineering problems.

Previously, from 2020 to 2021, I was a Visiting Research Student at [Dongguan University of Technology](https://www.dgut.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Bin Ren](https://sme.dgut.edu.cn/info/1123/1432.htm) and focused my research on human-computer interaction.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and electronic design automation.

I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in electronic information, computer science, artificial intelligence, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, or related fields to collaborate on research in areas such as algorithm development, embedded systems, and electronic design automation.
