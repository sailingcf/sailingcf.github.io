I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Physics and Electronic Information at [Gannan Normal University](https://www.gnnu.edu.cn/).
Previously, I received the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from [Guangdong University of Technology](https://www.gdut.edu.cn/) in 2025, 
the M.S. degree in Control Engineering from Guangdong University of Technology in 2022, 
and the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Gannan University of Science and Technology in 2019. 
My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and electronic design automation.

I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with background in electronic information, computer science, artificial intelligence, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, or related areas, 
work on research including algorithms, embedded systems, and electronic design automation.
